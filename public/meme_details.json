However, the first large-scale and organized propaganda campaign  was brought on by the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, during which both the British and German governments mass produced a series of posters, newsletters and even films to encourage voluntary recruitment of military forces and instill a strong sense of nationalism. Decades later, the use of propaganda grew and expanded drastically in the wake of the World War II, with the United States government leading the efforts by introducing nearly 200,000 different designs and messages for posters, radio broadcasts, films and newspapers, as well as other governments of both the Allies (United Kingdom, French Resistance, Soviet Russia) and the Axis (Nazi Germany, Italy and Japan).",
